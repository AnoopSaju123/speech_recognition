Speech Recognition
==================  
This is basically a python code to execute simple tasks like playing or downloading youtube videos and peforming simple tasks like opening calculator,searching in google etc.
This uses Google speech recognition for recognising the audio and also uses that to get the id of the video you want to stream.

I used  [pafy] to download the video with the id I had found
